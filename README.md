This programming project was created for my COP 3330C class. This features a java application using springboot. The website is designed as an online form. The user will
enter their first and last name along with their VID (Valencia ID -- assuming user is a student), date, and custom message. After, the page will print the user's 
full name, the date, and their message within a bootstrap card and Valencia College logo.

Below are screenshots with example:
